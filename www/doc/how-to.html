<h2> How-To: Making Application Content Accessible to Site-Wide
Search</h2> by <a href="khy@arsdigita.com">Khy Huang</a>
<hr>

<h3> I. Introduction </h3> 

This document explains how to make application content accessible to
the Site Wide Search (SWS) package.  Site maintainers are encouraged
to read the <a href="design">design</a> doc for more information on
the structure of the SWS package.  <p>

There are essentially two different scenarios in which developers will
want to include application content within the scope of the SWS
package:

<ol> <li> When developing applications which recycle an object type
first introduced elsewhere in the system.  <li> When developing
applications which define their own object types.
</ol>
<br>

<h3> II. Scenarios </h3> 

<b> Scenario 1: Applications which recycle object types from elsewhere in the system</b>
<br>

<br>Procedure:
<ol>
   <li> Verify that those application object types within your
   application which you'd like to make searchable meet the SWS
   requirements listed below.  <li> For each such searchable object
   type, provide a display page for that type; see below for details
   on this..  <li> For each such object type, register this object
   type and the associated display pages using the pot_service PL/SQL
   package; see below for details on this.
</ol>

SWS requirements on object types:
<ol>
<li> 
Object types must implement the sws_display interface.</li>
<li> 
Object types must implement the sws_indexing interface and/or store the data in acs_contents.</li>
</ol>

There are two calls within the acs_interface package, each used to check whether an object type implements an interface:
<ul>
<li>object_id_implement_p, which checks whether the object type of an object implements an interface when given an object id, and
<li>object_type_implement_p, which checks whether the object type implements an interface when given that object type itself.</ul>

An example:
<pre>
declare
    v_implement_p     char(1);
begin
    -- 't' or 'f'
    v_implement_p := object_type_implement_p ('sws_display', 'pl/sql', content_revision);
end;
</pre>

If an object type is already in the system yet does
not support site wide search, this second case explains how to include
object types within the scope of SWS. Doing so involves modifications
to the object type package definition and declaration. <b> ***
Important *** </b> Remember that recompiling the object type package
declaration in Oracle invalidates those functions and procedures which
use them, so you'll need to recompile those packages as well.
<p>

On display page attributes:<p>

After the SWS requirements have been verified for the searchable
object types, applications will need to register the object types used
and, for each object type, specify the display page attribute. So for
each searchable object type there should be a page to handle the
display for the object type or an appropriate redirect page.
Consider, for example, a file-storage application built on top of the
ACS Content Repository.  In that case the file-storage application
would use the content_revision object type.
<p>

<pre>
begin
    pot_service.register_object_type (
	package_key		=> 'file-storage',
	object_type		=> 'content_revision'
    );

    pot_service.set_obj_type_attr_value (
	package_key		=> 'file-storage',
	object_type		=> 'content_revision',
	attribute		=> 'display_page',
	attribute_value		=> 'file?file_id='
    );    
end;
</pre> 
<br>

Note, the display_page attribute is an URL page template.  The URL on
the search result page will include the object id appended to the end
of the display_page attribute value.  Reusing an object type already
set up for site wide search is straightforward; create a page to
display instances of the object type and register the object type with the
pot_service.

<br><br> <b> Scenario 2: Developing applications which define their
own object types.</b><p>

Procedure:
<ol>
<li> Implement the sws_display interface methods.  
<li> Implement the sws_indexing interface if the data is not stored in
acs_contents or if a preferred searchable representation of the
data is stored elsewhere.
<li> Register the object type with the pot_service
</ol>

<b> 1. Implement sws_display interface methods</b> <p>

In the PL/SQL environment, object types are assumed to have names prefixed by the package.  Thus when an object type implements an
interface, the methods specified for the interface are
declared and defined within the object type package itself.  Another option 
,which avoids modification to the object type package, is have a separate
package provide the methods.  In the call to register the object type, an optional
parameter may be provide to specify the package that has the interface methods.   SWS requires
object types to implement the 'sws_display' interface.  The
sws_display interface consists of six methods:

<pre>
    function sws_title (
	object_id		in acs_objects.object_id%type
    ) return varchar2;

    function sws_url (
	object_id           in acs_objects.object_id%type
    ) return varchar2;

    function sws_summary (
	object_id		in acs_objects.object_id%type
    ) return varchar2;

    function sws_req_permission (
	object_id		in acs_objects.object_id%type
    ) return varchar2;

    function sws_site_node_id (
	object_id           in acs_objects.object_id%type
    ) return site_nodes.node_id%TYPE;
 
    function sws_application_id (
	object_id	    in acs_objects.object_id%type
    ) return apm_packages.package_id%TYPE;
</pre>

The methods sws_title and sws_summary are used to get information to
display on the search result page. The sws_req_permission retrieves
the required permission that the user performing the search needs in
order to view the object on the search page.  The methods sws_url and
sws_application are used to get the URL information. The last method,
sws_site_node_id, is used for providing subsite information. For the
last three methods, sws_url, and sws_application, and
sws_site_node_id, there are default implementations provided in the
sws_service_interface PL/SQL package. The default implementation assumes
that the package id is within the object instance's context tree. This
distinction is important because certain objects that are used by different
packages may not have a package id in its context tree.  In cases 
where the package id is not used as the context id, rewriting these three 
methods are required. In the sws_url package, the display page provided 
by the SWS pot package should still be used for determing the display page 
within the application. 

For default implementation, developers can can just paste the following 
code for the three methods into their package
definitions:

<pre>
    function sws_url (
	object_id           in acs_objects.object_id%type
    ) return varchar2
    is        
	url			varchar2(3000);	    
    begin 
	url := sws_service_interface.sws_url (
	       object_id	    => object_id 
	);
	return url||to_char(object_id);
    end;

    function sws_site_node_id (
	object_id           in acs_objects.object_id%type
    ) return site_nodes.node_id%TYPE
    is
	node_id		    site_nodes.node_id%type;
    begin
	node_id := sws_service_interface.sws_site_node_id (
			object_id	    => object_id
		   );
	return node_id;         
    end;

    function sws_application_id (
	object_id	    in acs_objects.object_id%type
    ) return apm_packages.package_id%TYPE
    is
	v_application_id	apm_packages.package_id%type;
    begin
	v_application_id := sws_service_interface.sws_application_id (
				object_id	=> object_id
			    );
	return v_application_id;
    end;
</pre>

The methods associated with the sws_service_interface above use
the pot_service (short for 'package object types') package.  The pot_service
stores the object type display page for each package.  Given an object
type and a package, the pot_service provides the relevant display page.

<p>

The last necessary step is to register the object as implementing the
sws_display interface.
<pre>
    begin
       acs_interface.assoc_obj_type_with_interface (
           interface_name           => 'sws_display' ,
	   programming_language     => 'pl/sql'      ,
           object_type              => '<object_type>',
	   object_type_imp          => '<package impl>' -- this optional parameter 
	                                                   specifies another package 
							   that provides the 
							   implementation.
       );
    end;
</pre>
<p>

<b>2. Implement the sws_indexing interface </b> <p>

This interface consists of one method, sws_index_proc (rid, blob). SWS
uses the sws_indexing interface to provide search functionality to
allow object types to specify a different content to be indexed
instead of the one stored in acs_contents table.  If the object type
does not implement this interface, then the content stored in
acs_contents is used.  This option can prove useful in scenarios in
which the textual description of the object is stored in another
location and the graphic representation is stored in acs_contents or
when data is stored in a different table then acs_contents. A
good working example of this is the current ACS Content Repository, wherein 
content is stored in cr_revisions.  Copying the content from
cr_revisions to acs_contents would be a waste of space.  Instead of
copying the data over, for every entry of cr_revisions there is an entry
in acs_contents with an empty blob.  The code below is added to the
content_revision package:
<pre>
create or replace package body content_revision
as
    ....
    procedure sws_index_proc (
	object_id	    in acs_objects.object_id%TYPE,
	bdata		    in out nocopy blob
    ) 
    is
	v_bdata		    blob; 
	v_size		    integer;
    begin
	select content into v_bdata 
	from cr_revisions 
	where revision_id = object_id;
	
	v_size := dbms_lob.getlength(v_bdata);

	if v_size > 0 then 
	    dbms_lob.copy (
		dest_lob    => bdata,
		src_lob	    => v_bdata,
		amount	    => v_size
	    );
	end if;
    end sws_index_proc;
end content_revision;
</pre>       

Even though the indexed content was stored in another table, there
still needs to be a row in the acs_contents table. One way of synchronizing
the table where the data is stored with acs_contents is to use
insert, update, and delete triggers. The triggers for the
content_revision type are enumerated below: <br>

<pre>
create or replace trigger content_revision_itrg
after insert on cr_revisions
for each row
declare
    v_bdata	blob;
    v_size	integer;
begin
   
    insert into acs_contents (
	content_id,
	searchable_p)
     values ( 
	:new.revision_id,
	't'
    );
end;
/

create or replace trigger content_revision_utrg
after update on cr_revisions
for each row
declare
    v_bdata	blob;
    v_size	integer;
begin
    update acs_contents 
    set nls_language    = :new.nls_language,
	mime_type	= :new.mime_type
    where content_id	= :new.revision_id;
end;
/

create trigger content_revision_dtrg
after delete on cr_revisions
for each row
declare
begin
    delete from acs_contents
    where content_id = :old.revision_id;
end;
/
</pre> 

<br>
Finally, there needs to be a call to the acs_interface method to register that the object type implements the sws_indexing interface. 
<br>
<pre>
    begin
       acs_interface.assoc_obj_type_with_interface (
           interface_name           => 'sws_indexing' ,
	   programming_language     => 'pl/sql'      ,
           object_type              => '<object_type>'
	   object_type_imp          => '<package imp>' -- (optional) provides the implementation in this package
	                                                   instead of object type package
	                                                   
       );
    end;
</pre>

<b>Note:</b> this is only optional if the object type does not store its content in acs_contents. 
<br><br>
<b>3. Register with the pot service</b> <p>

This process is the same for scenario 1 above.  The application
registers the object type and the display page for that instance of the object
type.

<h3> III. Notes </h3>

What happens when a type's supertype supports SWS? Does this imply that the
type inherits the SWS interface itself?  Since acs_interfaces are not
inherited, the type must implement the sws_display and sws_indexing
(only if needed) interfaces. The simplest approach to ensuring that this takes place is to call the
supertype's methods in the type's package method definitions.  Having
the subtype provide the interface implementation solves the
problem of the supertype not supporting SWS. Another solution would
involve modifying the supertype package to implement the interface.
As mentioned earlier, changing the supertype package definition would
invalidate the other functions or methods which use the supertype
package.  These methods would have to be recompiled.
