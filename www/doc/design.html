<h3> 
II. Introduction </h3>

Site Wide Search (SWS) provides searching capability for web site content.
It supports sub-sites, application selections, and permissions
checking.  There are two types of users within site wide search,
developer and end user.  The developer needs to be able to specify
application data which should be available to site wide search,
whereas the end user needs a general search tool with a reasonable set of
basic search primitives (i.e. boolean logic, themes, keywords) to
find relevant content.  Developers will need to have a firm grasp on
ACS 4 architecture in order to set up SWS to produce the correct display
and support for sub-sites.  There is a SWS framework to follow for
including data for searching. The frame work guidelines are discussed
under the Configuration section.


<h3>
III. Historical Consideration </h3>
 
The pre-ACS 4.0 version of Site Wide Search required application
developers to write triggers or procedures to construct content for
Oracle Intermedia to index.  An advantage of having a procedure
construct the data in this way is that applications may then choose to
have other pieces of information included in addition to or in place
of the body of the search context, such as keywords.  The new
SWS indexes data from the acs_contents table. However, object types
may implement an interface with a method that provides the data to be
indexed in place of the content in acs_contents. Most applications
will default to search using the content stored in ACS_contents.
Currently in ACS 4.x, there is a Content Reposistory (CR)
system that stores the content in the cr_revision table. In a future release, 
CR will use the acs_contents for storing its data.  The interim 
solution, for CR to include its content in SWS, is
to use the interface.
<p> Previously, the SWS setup script had to be run separately to
avoid the namespace collision in ctxsys schema for each ACS
installation, as the naming of procedures are unique within the ctsxys
schema, e.g., when installing development, staging, and production
under the same Oracle DB with different schemas. The new setup script
addresses the namespace collision problem by using a mapping table for
the procedure names for each schema.

<h3>
IV. Competitive Analysis </h3> 

General search engines such as Google and Altavista are great for
finding content on the Web, however these search tools do not have
access to information about the framework of a web site such as access
control.  For example, users may receive a set of links from a search
that they do not have access to view.  It is frustrating for users to
click on the link only to get an access denied page.  Thus, at the
level of performing an internal site wide search, there is a room to
improve on search functionality by employing a tool that is
architecture-aware.  SWS is now specifically designed for the ACS 4.x
architectur and as such is aware of the internal framework
(i.e. permissions, sub-sites, applications, etc..).  As a result, the
SWS will only return results that are live and accessible to the user
performing the search in question. In addition, the result set can be
displayed in a manner that reflects the structure of the site, such as
displaying the results by sub-sites or applications.


<h3> 
V.Design Tradeoffs </h3>

<b>10.20 Storing information vs. Interface</b> <p>

In the previous
version of SWS, the link and title of the content was stored in a
table.  If the piece of content was returned from a search, the
display on the page would be the title of the content hyperlinked to
the stored link. Under the ACS 4 framework, storing the title and
hyperlink for each content (object) is not feasible since the object
could be referenced by multiple applications. Even if the object was
referenced by only one application, this would still not resolve the
issue as to where the title should be hyperlinked. Under the APM,
applications can be mapped to multiple site nodes.  The solution is to
require object_types interested in being searchable to implement the
'sws_display' interface. The 'sws_display' interface consist of six
methods (sws_application_id, sws_site_node_id, sws_req_permission,
sws_link, sws_title, sws_summary). Object types will use these methods to help SWS determine under which application and site node relevant content should be referenced. <p>

<b>10.30 Tcl vs. PL/SQL Interface </b> <p>

We went through some discussion as to whether we should have the
interfaces implemented in the TCL or PL/SQL environment.  Our main
concerns were the performance issue as well as  providing presentation layer
information.  The performance issue concerned the display of the result
set: to display a page that returns 50 rows, every row would result in
a call to sws_title and sws_title (maybe sws_summary).  The PL/SQL
procedure would be faster in getting the result compared to the TCL
call.  The second issue was whether to have the PL/SQL layer provide
presentation layer information, in this case the link to the content.
To implement the interface call in TCL, namespaces would be
used. Currently, there are bugs in the implementation of namespace
under AOL Server.  To avoid these bugs and continue with development,
the decision was made to have interfaces implemented in PL/SQL.  <p>

<b>10.40 Partial Storage of content attribute information </b> <p>

The implementation of the PL/SQL Interface uses dynamic SQL for each
method call. Executing dynamic SQLs incurs a performance hit when
running the search. Optimization is needed on the search query
considering the length of time side wide search takes under ACS 3.4x
without dynamic SQLs.  The solution to this is to remove all dynamic
SQLs from the search query and store them in a separate table.  The
current search query contains application id for grouping by
applications, site node id for grouping by sub-site, and permission
for access checking.  These three fields are stored in
sws_search_contents when the content is marked as searchable or
updated in acs_contents.  The disadvantage of storing in the table is
the application_id, node id, and permission could be invalid when the
search query runs, likely in a scenario in which an admin decides to
reorganize the structure of the site nodes after operating a web site
for awhile.  Currently the fix is to have a page for an administrator
to reinitialize the content attributes after any changes to sites
node. A more elegant approach would be to have a call back function for
modifications to the site nodes. Unfortunately such a mechanism is not
available under the current framework.

<h3>
VI. API </h3>

The packages are organized into three layers, application, object type, and search.
The application layer stores the application specific information for the object type, object type is the middle layer that provides information about the specific object type to the search layer, and the search layer provides querying and indexing of the data. 
<p>
<b> Application Layer </b><p>

The application section consists of the Package Object Types (pot)
package. It maintains attributes for object types within a package
context. Currently only one attribute is specified: 
'display_page'; packages register a display page for viewing an object
type instance that was created within its context.  The display_page
value is a relative URL template; the template is a get method
requiring an object id for the suffix.  For example, the file-storage
application would register "file?file_id=" as the display_page
attribute value for the content-revision object type. This example
assumes that the content-revision object type is used by the
file-storage.

The Package Object Type has the following associated methods:
<pre>

--  packages use these methods to register the object types in use
    procedure register_object_type
    procedure unregister_object_type 

--  Currently only one attribute is defined, display_page
    procedure create_attribute 
    procedure drop_attribute 

--  Packages that create new object types could specify the default attributes values using these methods
    procedure set_default_attr_value 
    procedure delete_default_attr_value 
    function get_default_attr_value 

--  Methods for packages to specify object type attribute values within the package context. 
    procedure set_obj_type_attr_value ;
    procedure delete_obj_type_attr_value;
    function get_obj_type_attr_value;
</pre>


<p>
<b> Object type layer</b>
<p>

This layer consists of object types implementing the sws_display and
the optional sws_indexing interfaces.  In the PL/SQL environment, we
make the assumption is that an ACS object type has a package with the
same name.  An object type implementing an interface in PL/SQL means
that the object type package contains all the methods defined by the
interface and registers with the ACS Interface package.  Registering
with ACS Interface consists in employing the 
acs_interface.assoc_obj_type_with_interface procedure call.
Another option, besides having the object type package provide the 
interface methods, is to have another package provide the methods. 
This avoids modifications to the object packages already in place.
In the call to acs_interface.assoc_obj_type_with_interface there is 
an optional parameter, object_type_imp, for specifying an external package
that has the implementation. 

<ul>
<li>
sws_display <br>
<blockquote>
The "sws_display" interface methods are used when retrieving an
object's URL, display, and permission information.  The Search layer
calls these methods in order to build the search result page.  There are six
methods in the interface: <ol> <li> sws_title </li> <li> sws_summary
</li> <li> sws_req_permission </li> <li> sws_site_node_id </li> <li>
sws_application_id </li> <li> sws_url.  </li>
</ol>
The sws_title and sws_summary are used to display object information
for the search result page. The sws_req_permission function is used to
get the permission required to view object on the search page.  The
last three functions are used to compute the URL at which to view the object
type instance.  SWS has provided default implementations for the last
three functions.  The last three functions use the ACS context tree
and application layer pot service to compute an URL to display an
object; ACS contexts are used to compute the site node and application
context of an object, and the application layer stores the relative URL
template for an object type.  The default implementation is located in
sws_service_interface package.  Object types may call these methods
directly.
</blockquote>
<li> 
sws_indexing <br>
<blockquote>
The 'sws_indexing' interface provides a facility for object types to
store searchable data in a different location than in the acs_contents
table. An example is the content_revision object type in the ACS
Content Repository service. The content_revision stores its data in
cr_revision table. Instead of copying the data from cr_revision to
acs_contents, the content_revision would implement the sws_indexing
interface. When SWS is indexing the data, it will call the method in
the "sws_indexing" interface for all the content_revision object type
instance instead of using the data stored in
acs_contents. </blockquote>
</ul>

<p>
<b> Search Layer</b>
<p>

The Search layer uses Oracle Intermedia to index object type data.
Rows in acs_contents table where the searchable_p column is 't' are
indexed.  The content that actually gets indexed is dependent upon
whether the object type supports the 'sws_indexing' interface as
specified in the object type layer above. If the object type does not
support the sws_indexing interface, then the data stored in the content column of acs_contents is used. If the object type supports the
interface, the sws_indexing interface method within the originating object type
package is called to get data for indexing.
<p>

There is one package for the Search layer, sws_service package.  There
are methods to rebuild the indexes for recently updated and all data.
Other methods are wrappers for calling the interface methods for an
object type.
<pre>

    -- reindexes all content      
    procedure rebuild_all_index;
</pre>

<h3>

VII. Data Model Discussion  </h3>

<b> Intermedia Setup </b> <p>

Intermedia setup consists of a table named sws_procedures and a package named
sws_procedure that stores the mapping of the desired procedure name
to a generated one in ctxsys schema and procedure creation/deletion
functionality under ctxsys schema, respectively. This enables each ACS
installation to use the same procedure name within the Ctxsys schema.
<p>
The procedure mapping table sws_procedures is as follows:
<pre>
create table sws_procedures (
    procedure_id		integer 
	constraint sws_proc_proc_id_pk primary key,
    schema			varchar2(30)
	constraint sws_proc_schema_nn not null,
    procedure_name		varchar2(20)
	constraint sws_proc_proc_name_nn not null,
    actual_procedure_name	varchar2(30)
	constraint sws_proc_act_proc_name_nn not null,
    creation_date		date
	constraint sws_creation_date_nn not null,
    constraint sws_proc_schema_proc_name_un unique (schema, procedure_name)
);
</pre>

The sws_procedure package is as follows:
<pre>

	    function create_procedure (
		schema		    in sws_procedures.schema%TYPE,
		procedure_name      in sws_procedures.procedure_name%TYPE,
		call_procedure	    in varchar2
	    ) return varchar2;

	    procedure drop_procedure (
		schema		    in sws_procedures.schema%TYPE,
		procedure_name      in sws_procedures.procedure_name%TYPE
	    );

	    function get_actual_procedure (
		schema		    in sws_procedures.schema%TYPE,
		procedure_name	    in sws_procedures.procedure_name%TYPE
	    ) return sws_procedures.actual_procedure_name%TYPE;

	    procedure clean_schema (
		schema		in sws_procedures.schema%type
	    );
</pre>
<br>
The create_procedure method creates a procedure with the following
signature: <i> procedure_<next_id> (rid in ROWID, bdata in out nocopy
BLOB) </i><br> The new procedure calls the passed-in call_procedure
parameter with rid and bdata as parameters.
<p>

<b> Site Wide Search </b> <p>

There is one table, sws_search_contents. The table stores the
content_id, application_id, and the required permission for each
object.  The reason for storing these piece of information is to
remove dynamic SQLs in the 'where' clause.

<pre>
create table sws_search_contents (
    content_id		integer
	constraint sws_search_content_id_pk primary key
	constraint sws_search_content_id_fk references acs_contents(content_id) on delete cascade,
    -- application that owns this content
    application_id	integer
	constraint sws_search_appl_id_fk references apm_applications on delete cascade,
    node_id		integer
	constraint sws_search_node_id_fk references site_nodes on delete cascade,
    permission_req	varchar2(100),
    data_store		char(1)	
);
</pre>

<h3>
VIII. User Interface </h3>

The user interface is the index.adp page that includes the
search-form.adp.  Search-form.adp provides users a form to enter key
words and options for selecting subsites, search methods, and
grouping.  The query is built, processed, and displayed by search.tcl.

<h3>
IX. Configuration/Parameters </h3>

System Setup:
<ul>
   <li> Ensure that Oracle Intermedia is set up correctly with INSO
   filter (For Linux INSO filter is only available with Oracle 8.1.7EE
   and later) <li> Grant create procedure privilege to user under
   current and ctxsys schema.  <li> Run the
   intermedia-setup-create.sql under the ctxsys schema for each Oracle
   Instance. Do not run this for every ACS installation on a Oracle
   instance.
</ul>

Object type setup for site wide search: <p>

Step 1: Object types that wants to be included in the scope of SWS
must implement the sws_display interface.  This assumes there is a one
to one mapping from package to object type name. <p>

The object type consist of six methods:
<ul>
   <li> function get_application_id (object_id    in acs_object.object_id%type) return integer;
   <li> function get_site_node_id (object_id    in acs_object.object_id%type) return integer;
   <li> function get_req_permission (object_id    in acs_object.object_id%type) return varchar2;
   <li> function get_title (object_id in acs_object.object_id%type) return varchar2; -- max 1000 char
   <li> function get_summary (object_id in acs_object.object_id%type) return varchar2; - max 4000 char
   <li> function get link (object_id in acs_object.object_id%type) return varchar2; - max 1000 char
</ul>
<p> 

Step 2: Register the fact that the object type has implemented an
interface <p> <ul><li>call acs_interface.assoc_obj_type_with_interface
('sws_display', 'pl/sql', object_type);</ul>
<p>
Developers are encouraged to read the <a href=how-to>how-to </a> doc
for an even more detailed step process for adding application content
to the scope of SWS.

<h3>
X. Future Improvements </h3>
<ul> 
   <li> Administrator pages to tweak intermedia parameters
   <li> Add parameters to specify which packages should be searched.
   <li> More advanced search features 
   <li> Call back function for modifications to site nodes
   <li> Inclusion of content attributes for search
</ul>
